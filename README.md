# The Queen's War

> Since the dawn of time, war has prioritized the King and his army. Not this time! The queen's war is an automated version of the classic card game War. In this version, the Ace is low, and the queen is high. You are fighting to defend her queendom and honor. 


## Card Ranks
All suits are created equal. Below, the cards are ranked from highest to lowest:

1. Queen
2. King
3. Jack
4. 10
5. 9
6. 8
7. 7
8. 6
9. 5
10. 4
11. 3
12. 2
13. Ace

## How to play
In order to play, all you need to do is run the code and observe.

1. Fork and clone this repository.
2. Open the script.js file in the source code editor of your choice.
3. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).
4. Open the terminal and enter **node script.js**.

## Rules of the game:
Each player is dealt half of the deck of cards (26 each). Each player draws a card and plays that card. A winner is decided based on the rank above. The winning player adds all of the cards in play into their personal pile. If there is a tie, each player places 3 cards face down and plays the fourth card to determine the winner of the war. The winner is decided based on the ranks of the cards (shown above) and if there is a tie...you go to war again! A winner is decided when one player runs out of cards to play with (including not having enough cards to contribute to war).
